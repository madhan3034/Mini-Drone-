# Mini-Drone-
This project is an open-source micro-drone flight controller based on the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-S3, MPU6050 IMU, and AO3400 MOSFET motor drivers.
It is designed for lightweight 1S LiPo coreless motor drones and provides full stabilization, motor mixing, PID control, and battery monitoring.
