This repository contains the full hardware and firmware resources for a 1S micro-drone flight controller built using the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-S3, MPU6050 IMU, and AO3400 MOSFET motor drivers.
The system is designed for coreless brushed motors, supporting:

Full stabilization (roll, pitch, yaw)

PID control loop

Motor mixing

Web-based configuration (original ESP-Drone system)

1-cell LiPo battery monitoring

Lightweight 65–85 mm drones
